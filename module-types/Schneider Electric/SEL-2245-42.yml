manufacturer: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
model: SEL-2245-42 AC Protection Module
description: The SEL-2245-42 module includes three CTs with isolated returns and includes 
three PTs (or VTs) for measuring ac signals. This module has galvanically isolated inputs 
and can sample events at user software-selectable rates of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 kHz. Up to 
16 SEL-2245-42 modules can be used in one Axion system and feature synchronized 
measurements throughout all modules. This enables time-deterministic control algorithms to
take advantage of the common reference for all measurements, even those in distributed 
locations. Collect IEEE C37.118.1a-2014-compliant synchrophasor data from up to 64 phasor 
quantities. Provide digital fault recording (DFR) capabilities with the Axion to record 
and analyze power system dynamics and validate equipment performance.
